# Real-time-Streaming-Data-Pipeline-using-Flink-and-Kinesis
Perishable data quickly loses value as conditions change, making it less useful over time. Common in IoT systems, it enables real-time insights and faster decisions through edge computing. This project simulates real-time accident data and builds a pipeline for quick analysis using AWS Kinesis, Apache Flink, Grafana, and Amazon SNS.
